# Time-varying optimization code
Code for time-varying optimization

See the review paper:
- [Optimization and Learning with Information Streams: Time-varying Algorithms and Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08123) by Emiliano Dall'Anese, Andrea Simonetto, Stephen Becker, and Liam Madden (October 2019).

## Code
We have basic Matlab code that supports the paper.
- `demo_reviewPaperFig1.m` recreates Figure 1 from the paper (relies on the file `firstOrderMethod.m`).

The code should make two plots that look like the following:

![Static optimization output](static.png?raw=true "Static example")

![Time-varying optimization output](dynamic.png?raw=true "Dynamic example")
